### About

tasktemple is a straightforward to-do list app built with vanilla JavaScript that allows the user to organise their tasks into projects. Basic features such as priority, due date and project progress (derived from number of tasks within project completed/uncompleted) are included.

### New skills developed:

- **firebase**

    firebase-auth and firebase realtime databse were both used in this project

- **webpack**

    I further honed my skills in webpack (partiularly getting to grips with development vs. production environments, using plugins such as HtmlWebpackPlugin and file loaders)

- **ES6 modules**

    ES6 modules were used within this project. Focus will be spent on future in reducing circular dependencies (which were revealed when I analysed my project using [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer))
