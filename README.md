## About

![App Demo](https://i.imgur.com/0qQz1wh.gif 'App Demo')

tasktemple is a straightforward to-do list app built with vanilla JavaScript that lets you group your tasks into projects. Basic features such as priority, due date and project progress (derived from number of tasks within project completed/uncompleted) are included.

## Key learns

- **ES6 modules**

  ES6 modules were used within this project. I learned about importing and exporting modules between seperate JavaScript files, and the improved maintanability that keeping separate files provides.

- **webpack**

  I further honed my skills in webpack (partiularly getting to grips with development vs. production environments, using plugins such as HtmlWebpackPlugin and file loaders to handles assets)

- **firebase**

  firebase-auth and firebase realtime databse were both used in this project, to handle persistent user data across platforms.
